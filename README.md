# STL and Templated Containers in C++98

## Project Overview

This module is designed to help you understand **templated containers**, **iterators**, and **algorithms** in C++98. Through hands-on examples, you will learn how to utilize generic containers, iterate through them, and apply algorithms for efficient problem-solving.

## Concepts Covered

- **Templated Containers**: Work with containers that store any data type.
- **Iterators**: Navigate and manipulate container elements.
- **Algorithms**: Apply standard algorithms to solve common problems.

## Requirements

- C++98 compliant compiler.
- makefile

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amdouyah/STL-cpp-08.git
